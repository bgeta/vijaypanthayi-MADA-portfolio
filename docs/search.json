    "text": "Hello! My name is Vijay Panthayi. Currently, I am twenty-two years of age and pursuing my masters degree in public health with a concentration in biostatistics. My long-term goal is to become a pediatric immunologist and my research interests are in allergies and allergy medication. To get there, I completed a bachelors in chemistry with a pre-med concentration and have done research and shadowing related to immunology and allergies.\nI currently have little to no programming knowledge (unless you count AP Comp Sci in high school). However, throughout my MPH degree, I have learned some basic level data analysis and moderate level statistical knowledge. I hope that this course not only ties together the knowledge I have learned previously, but I will be able to apply it into practice.\nHere is an interesting video I found regarding starting data analysis from scratch: How I Would Lean Data Analysis (If I Could Start Over)\nOutside of school and work, I play the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game competitively. Itâ€™s been very fun and has allowed me to travel and make friends I talk to almost daily."
